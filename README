= aglet - a Twitter client with Shoes on

Hallo. I was using Tweetr, one of many Twitter clients built on AIR. But it annoyed me. And I was curious about Shoes. I like shoes. And Shoes is pretty good, too. Anyway, here is another Twitter client for your desk topping.

= Installation and Setup

Currently, to use Aglet, you must create a file named ".aglet_cred" in your user's home directory with two lines: username and password. This setup will be done in the app later once some issues with certain UI components are worked out in Shoes. I can probably also learn a different way to approach it. In due time!

Also, I am having errors with the packaged version of the app, at least on OS X. So, for now you need to clone a copy of the repo and run that with the shoes command or Shoes.app.
