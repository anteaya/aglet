h1. Aglet - a Twitter client with Shoes on

!>{border: 10px solid #fff}http://github.com/greatseth/aglet/tree/master%2Fwhale.png?raw=true!

Hallo. I was using Tweetr, one of many Twitter clients built on AIR. But it annoyed me. And I was curious about Shoes. I like shoes. And Shoes is pretty good, too. Anyway, here is another Twitter client for your desk topping.

h2. Installation and Setup

When saving your user credentials, you will probably notice that switching to the timeline doesn't exactly work. Restart the app and you are good to go. Sorry, looking into that one.

Also, I am having errors with the packaged version of the app, at least on OS X. So, for now you need to clone a copy of the repo and run that with the shoes command or Shoes.app.
